Enumerations for the Social Fabric Matrix (SFM) framework.

This module defines controlled vocabularies and classification systems used throughout
the SFM analysis framework, based on F. Gregory Hayden's institutional economics work.
These enumerations provide consistent categorization for values, institutions, resources,
flows, and relationships in socio-economic systems.

## Theoretical Foundation

This module implements key concepts from Hayden's Social Fabric Matrix framework:
- **Value Categories**: Multi-dimensional value systems beyond market pricing
- **Institution Layers**: Formal rules, organizations, and informal norms
- **Resource Types**: Comprehensive resource classification for institutional analysis
- **Flow Nature**: Patterns of resource and value movement through systems
- **Relationship Kinds**: Institutional relationships and dependencies

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Usage Examples

```python
from core.sfm_models import Indicator, Flow, Relationship, Actor, Institution
from core.sfm_enums import ValueCategory, FlowNature, RelationshipKind, ResourceType

# Create an economic indicator
gdp_indicator = Indicator(
    label="GDP Growth",
    value_category=ValueCategory.ECONOMIC,
    measurement_unit="percent",
    current_value=2.5
)

# Create a social indicator with multiple value dimensions  
sustainability_index = Indicator(
    label="Community Sustainability Index",
    value_category=ValueCategory.ENVIRONMENTAL,
    measurement_unit="index_score",
    current_value=75.2
)

# Create flows between actors
financial_flow = Flow(
    label="Subsidy Payment",
    nature=FlowNature.FINANCIAL,
    flow_type=FlowType.FINANCIAL
)

# Create institutional relationships
government = Actor(label="EPA", sector="Government")
farmers = Actor(label="Local Farmers", sector="Agriculture")

governs_rel = Relationship(
    source_id=government.id,
    target_id=farmers.id,
    kind=RelationshipKind.GOVERNS
)
```

### Integration with SFM Models

The enums integrate seamlessly with core SFM model classes:

- **ValueCategory**: Used in `Indicator` and `ValueSystem` for multi-dimensional
  measurement
- **InstitutionLayer**: Used in `Institution` for Hayden's three-layer framework
- **ResourceType**: Used in `Resource` for comprehensive resource classification
- **FlowNature/FlowType**: Used in `Flow` for movement pattern analysis
- **RelationshipKind**: Used in `Relationship` for institutional dependency mapping

### Validation and Constraints

The module includes validation through `EnumValidator` class that ensures:
- Compatible enum combinations (e.g., FlowNature.FINANCIAL with
  FlowType.FINANCIAL)
- Contextually appropriate usage (e.g., measurable ValueCategory for quantitative
  indicators)
- Cross-enum relationship consistency

### Type Hints and Patterns

All enums support standard typing patterns:

```python
from typing import Optional, List
from core.sfm_enums import ValueCategory, InstitutionLayer

def create_policy_indicator(
    value_cat: ValueCategory,
    institution_layer: Optional[InstitutionLayer] = None
) -> Indicator:
    # Implementation with proper type checking
    pass

# Enum membership testing
if ValueCategory.ECONOMIC in [ValueCategory.ECONOMIC, ValueCategory.SOCIAL]:
    # Handle economic indicators
    pass
```

class ValueCategory(Enum):
    """
    Categories of value in Hayden's Social Fabric Matrix framework.
    
    Based on F. Gregory Hayden's institutional analysis, these categories represent
    different dimensions of value creation, distribution, and impact within
    socio-economic systems. Hayden's framework extends beyond market-based value
    measurements to include social, environmental, and institutional dimensions
    essential for comprehensive policy analysis.
    
    ## Theoretical Background
    
    Hayden's SFM approach recognizes that economic systems create multiple types of
    value that cannot be adequately captured by market prices alone. This enum
    implements his multi-dimensional value framework, allowing analysts to track
    social benefits, environmental costs, institutional capacity, and other
    non-market values crucial for policy evaluation.
    
    ## Usage Examples
    
    ### Basic Indicator Creation
    ```python
    # Economic indicator (traditional market-based measurement)
    gdp_growth = Indicator(
        label="GDP Growth Rate",
        value_category=ValueCategory.ECONOMIC,
        measurement_unit="percent_annual",
        current_value=2.3
    )
    
    # Social equity indicator  
    income_inequality = Indicator(
        label="Gini Coefficient",
        value_category=ValueCategory.SOCIAL,
        measurement_unit="gini_index",
        current_value=0.45
    )
    
    # Environmental sustainability indicator
    carbon_footprint = Indicator(
        label="Carbon Emissions per Capita", 
        value_category=ValueCategory.ENVIRONMENTAL,
        measurement_unit="tons_co2_per_person",
        current_value=8.2
    )
    ```
    
    ### Multi-Dimensional Value Analysis
    ```python
    # Complex sustainability indicator spanning multiple value categories
    sustainability_index = Indicator(
        label="Community Sustainability Index",
        value_category=ValueCategory.ENVIRONMENTAL,  # Primary dimension
        measurement_unit="composite_score",
        current_value=68.5
    )
    # Note: Secondary categories can be tracked through metadata or 
    # additional indicator relationships
    ```
    
    ### Policy Impact Measurement
    ```python
    # Institutional capacity indicator for policy evaluation
    governance_quality = Indicator(
        label="Government Effectiveness Score",
        value_category=ValueCategory.INSTITUTIONAL,
        measurement_unit="percentile_rank",
        current_value=85.2
    )
    
    # Educational outcome indicator
    literacy_rate = Indicator(
        label="Adult Literacy Rate",
        value_category=ValueCategory.EDUCATIONAL,
        measurement_unit="percentage",
        current_value=99.1
    )
    ```
    
    ## Value Category Guidance
    
    **Core Hayden Categories** (from original SFM framework):
    - ECONOMIC: Market transactions, monetary flows, financial returns
    - SOCIAL: Distributional equity, social cohesion, community well-being  
    - ENVIRONMENTAL: Resource stocks, ecological integrity, sustainability
    - CULTURAL: Norms, beliefs, heritage, knowledge systems
    - INSTITUTIONAL: Governance quality, rule consistency, organizational capacity
    - TECHNOLOGICAL: Knowledge base, production techniques, innovation systems
    
    **Extended Categories** (for comprehensive analysis):
    Use when core categories are insufficient for capturing specific value dimensions
    relevant to your SFM analysis context.
    
    ## Integration with SFM Models
    
    ValueCategory integrates with:
    - `Indicator`: Primary classification for measurement metrics
    - `ValueSystem`: Hierarchical value structure definition
    - `PolicyInstrument`: Target value areas for policy intervention
    - `ChangeProcess`: Value dimensions affected by institutional change

class InstitutionLayer(Enum):
    """
    Hayden's three-layer institutional framework plus extended institutional forms.

    Based on F. Gregory Hayden's analysis of institutional structure, this enum represents
    the different layers at which institutions operate within socio-economic systems.
    Hayden's framework distinguishes between formal constitutional rules, organizational
    structures, and informal cultural norms, providing a comprehensive taxonomy for
    institutional analysis in SFM applications.
    
    ## Theoretical Foundation
    
    Hayden's institutional layering concept recognizes that social coordination occurs
    through multiple, interconnected institutional levels. This hierarchical structure
    helps analysts understand how formal rules, organizational structures, and cultural
    norms interact to shape economic behavior and social outcomes.
    
    ## Core Institutional Layers (Hayden's Framework)
    
    **FORMAL_RULE**: Constitutional and legal frameworks
    - Examples: Constitutions, statutes, property law, regulatory frameworks
    - Function: Establishes formal constraints and rights
    - SFM Role: Foundation for institutional matrix analysis
    
    **ORGANIZATION**: Structured collective entities  
    - Examples: Firms, government agencies, NGOs, labor unions, cooperatives
    - Function: Implements and operationalizes formal rules
    - SFM Role: Key actors in resource flows and value creation
    
    **INFORMAL_NORM**: Cultural practices and social expectations
    - Examples: Customs, habits, social expectations, professional ethics
    - Function: Guides behavior through social coordination mechanisms
    - SFM Role: Influences how formal institutions actually function
    
    ## Usage Examples
    
    ### Basic Institution Classification
    ```python
    # Formal legal institution
    environmental_law = Institution(
        label="Clean Air Act",
        layer=InstitutionLayer.FORMAL_RULE,
        description="Federal environmental regulation"
    )
    
    # Organizational institution
    epa = Institution(
        label="Environmental Protection Agency", 
        layer=InstitutionLayer.ORGANIZATION,
        description="Federal environmental regulatory agency"
    )
    
    # Informal institutional norm
    recycling_norm = Institution(
        label="Community Recycling Practices",
        layer=InstitutionLayer.INFORMAL_NORM,
        description="Local cultural practices for waste management"
    )
    ```
    
    ### Institutional Relationship Analysis
    ```python
    # Hierarchical institutional relationships
    constitution = Institution(label="US Constitution", layer=InstitutionLayer.FORMAL_RULE)
    congress = Institution(label="US Congress", layer=InstitutionLayer.ORGANIZATION)
    political_norms = Institution(label="Democratic Norms", layer=InstitutionLayer.INFORMAL_NORM)
    
    # Relationships showing institutional hierarchy
    implements_rel = Relationship(
        source_id=congress.id,
        target_id=constitution.id,
        kind=RelationshipKind.IMPLEMENTS
    )
    
    guided_by_rel = Relationship(
        source_id=congress.id,
        target_id=political_norms.id,
        kind=RelationshipKind.GUIDED_BY
    )
    ```
    
    ### Extended Institutional Forms
    ```python
    # Market mechanism as institutional form
    carbon_market = Institution(
        label="Carbon Credit Trading System",
        layer=InstitutionLayer.MARKET_MECHANISM,
        description="Market-based environmental policy instrument"
    )
    
    # International institutional regime
    paris_accord = Institution(
        label="Paris Climate Agreement",
        layer=InstitutionLayer.INTERNATIONAL_REGIME,
        description="Global climate governance framework"
    )
    
    # Hybrid public-private institution
    public_private_partnership = Institution(
        label="Infrastructure PPP",
        layer=InstitutionLayer.HYBRID_INSTITUTION,
        description="Mixed governance arrangement for infrastructure"
    )
    ```
    
    ## Integration with SFM Analysis
    
    InstitutionLayer enables:
    - **Hierarchical Analysis**: Understanding how different institutional levels interact
    - **Change Process Mapping**: Tracking how changes propagate across institutional layers
    - **Policy Design**: Identifying appropriate institutional levels for intervention
    - **Governance Assessment**: Evaluating institutional capacity at different layers
    
    ## Extended Categories
    
    Beyond Hayden's core three layers, the enum includes additional institutional forms
    relevant for contemporary SFM analysis:
    
    - **MARKET_MECHANISM**: Price systems, contracts, trading platforms
    - **NETWORK**: Collaborative structures, alliances, partnerships  
    - **INTERNATIONAL_REGIME**: Transnational agreements, global governance
    - **HYBRID_INSTITUTION**: Public-private partnerships, mixed governance forms

class ResourceType(Enum):
    """
    Classification of resource types within Social Fabric Matrix analysis.

    Categorizes different forms of resources that flow through socio-economic systems,
    including traditional economic resources and expanded categories relevant to
    institutional and technological analysis. This comprehensive taxonomy enables
    detailed tracking of resource flows, dependencies, and transformations in SFM models.
    
    ## Theoretical Background
    
    Resource classification in SFM analysis extends beyond traditional economic
    categories to include social, institutional, and informational resources crucial
    for understanding modern socio-economic systems. This approach reflects the
    institutional economics recognition that economic activity depends on diverse
    resource types, many of which are not captured in conventional economic accounting.
    
    ## Core Resource Categories
    
    **Traditional Economic Resources** (Hayden's original framework):
    - NATURAL: Land, water, raw minerals, biological resources
    - PRODUCED: Machinery, infrastructure, manufactured capital goods  
    - HUMAN: Labor, human capital, skills, knowledge embodied in people
    - INFORMATION: Data, R&D findings, patents, codified knowledge
    
    ## Usage Examples
    
    ### Basic Resource Creation
    ```python
    # Natural resource
    farmland = Resource(
        label="Agricultural Land",
        rtype=ResourceType.NATURAL,
        description="Fertile soil suitable for crop production"

        rtype=ResourceType.UTILITY,
        description="Electricity generation and distribution network"
    )
    ```
    
    ## Resource Flow Analysis
    
    Resources in SFM analysis participate in various flow relationships:
    
    ```python
    # Resource transformation flow
    iron_ore = Resource(label="Iron Ore", rtype=ResourceType.MINERAL)
    steel = Resource(label="Steel", rtype=ResourceType.PRODUCED)

        target_id=steel.id, 
        kind=RelationshipKind.PRODUCES
    )
    ```
    
    ## Extended Resource Categories
    
    **Energy Resources**: FOSSIL_FUEL, RENEWABLE, NUCLEAR, BIOENERGY
    - Enable detailed energy system analysis
    
    **Digital Resources**: DIGITAL, COMPUTATIONAL, DATA, NETWORK_INFRASTRUCTURE  
    - Support analysis of digital economy and information systems
    
    **Institutional Resources**: ORGANIZATIONAL, REGULATORY, MANAGERIAL
    - Capture institutional capacity and governance resources
    
    **Temporal Resources**: TEMPORAL, HISTORICAL, FUTURE_OPTION
    - Enable analysis of time-dependent and path-dependent processes
    
    ## Integration with SFM Models
    
    ResourceType integrates with:
    - `Resource`: Primary classification for all resource entities
    - `Flow`: Specification of what type of resource is flowing
    - `Actor`: Understanding resource ownership and control
    - `PolicyInstrument`: Targeting specific resource types for policy intervention

class FlowNature(Enum):
    """
    Classification of flow types and patterns in Social Fabric Matrix systems.

    Describes the nature, direction, timing, and purpose of flows of resources,
    information, value, and other elements through socio-economic systems.
    Essential for understanding system dynamics and transformation processes
    in Hayden's institutional analysis framework.
    
    ## Theoretical Foundation
    
    Flow analysis in SFM recognizes that socio-economic systems are fundamentally
    characterized by movements of resources, information, and value between actors
    and institutions. Understanding flow patterns is crucial for identifying
    system bottlenecks, dependencies, and transformation opportunities.
    
    ## Core Flow Types
    
    **Basic Flow Directions**:
    - INPUT: Resources or value entering a process or actor
    - OUTPUT: Products, services, or value leaving a process or actor  
    - TRANSFER: Direct exchange between actors without transformation
    
    ## Usage Examples
    
    ### Basic Flow Creation
    ```python
    # Input flow - resources entering production
    raw_materials_flow = Flow(
        label="Raw Material Supply",
        nature=FlowNature.INPUT,
        flow_type=FlowType.MATERIAL
    )
    
    # Output flow - products leaving production
    finished_goods_flow = Flow(
        label="Manufactured Products",
        nature=FlowNature.OUTPUT,
        flow_type=FlowType.MATERIAL
    )
    
    # Transfer flow - direct exchange
    payment_flow = Flow(
        label="Payment for Goods",
        nature=FlowNature.TRANSFER,
        flow_type=FlowType.FINANCIAL
    )
    ```
    
    ### Transformation-Based Flows

        nature=FlowNature.CONVERSION,
        flow_type=FlowType.ENERGY
    )
    
    # Resource extraction from natural systems
    mining_flow = Flow(
        label="Mineral Extraction",
        nature=FlowNature.EXTRACTION,
        flow_type=FlowType.MATERIAL

    knowledge_transfer = Flow(
        label="Skills Transfer Program",
        nature=FlowNature.SOCIAL,
        flow_type=FlowType.SOCIAL
    )
    ```
    
    ### Temporal Pattern Flows
    ```python
    # Continuous steady flows
    utility_service = Flow(
        label="Electrical Power Supply",
        nature=FlowNature.CONTINUOUS,
        flow_type=FlowType.ENERGY

        flow_type=FlowType.INFORMATION
    )
    ```
    
    ## Flow Integration with SFM Models
    
    ### Actor-to-Actor Flows
    ```python

        flow_type=FlowType.MATERIAL
    )
    
    # Establish flow relationships

        source_id=supplier.id,
        target_id=manufacturer.id,
        kind=RelationshipKind.SUPPLIES,
        flows=[supply_chain_flow.id]
    )
    ```
    
    ### Complex Flow Networks

class PolicyInstrumentType(Enum):
    """
    Classification of policy instrument types for implementation analysis.

    Categorizes the different mechanisms through which policies can be implemented
    and enforced in socio-economic systems, based on institutional economics and
    public policy analysis frameworks. Essential for understanding how policy goals
    are translated into specific implementation strategies.
    
    ## Theoretical Background
    
    Policy instrument classification recognizes that governments and institutions have
    multiple tools available for achieving policy objectives. The choice of instrument
    affects implementation costs, compliance mechanisms, distributional impacts, and
    political feasibility. This taxonomy enables systematic analysis of policy design
    choices within SFM frameworks.
    
    ## Core Instrument Types
    
    **REGULATORY**: Command-and-control mechanisms using legal authority
    **ECONOMIC**: Market-based mechanisms using financial incentives
    **VOLUNTARY**: Cooperative mechanisms relying on voluntary compliance
    **INFORMATION**: Education and disclosure mechanisms using information provision

    ## Change Analysis Patterns
    
    Different change types require different analytical approaches:
    
    - **Evolutionary**: Focus on adaptation mechanisms and gradual feedback
    - **Revolutionary**: Analyze disruption sources and transformation triggers  
    - **Cyclical**: Identify cycle patterns and timing factors
    - **Incremental**: Track cumulative effects and optimization processes
    
    ## Integration with Temporal Dynamics
    
    ChangeType works with temporal analysis:
    
    ```python
    # Change process with temporal tracking
    institutional_change = ChangeProcess(
        label="Healthcare System Reform",
        change_type=ChangeType.EVOLUTIONARY,
        change_trajectory=[
            TimeSlice(label="Pre-reform"),
            TimeSlice(label="Implementation"),
            TimeSlice(label="Post-reform")
        ],
        temporal_dynamics=TemporalDynamics(
            # Detailed time-based analysis
        )
    )
    ```

    Classification of behavioral patterns in Social Fabric Matrix analysis.

    Categorizes recurring patterns of behavior that actors exhibit in
    socio-economic systems, particularly relevant to Hayden's analysis of
    ceremonial versus instrumental behavior patterns that shape institutional
    dynamics and economic outcomes.
    
    ## Theoretical Background
    
    Hayden's institutional analysis distinguishes between different behavioral
    patterns that either support or hinder adaptive institutional development.
    Understanding these patterns is crucial for predicting institutional change
    and designing effective policy interventions.
    
    ## Core Behavior Patterns
    
    - **HABITUAL**: Routine, unconscious behaviors following established patterns
    - **STRATEGIC**: Deliberate, goal-oriented behaviors with explicit objectives
    - **ADAPTIVE**: Flexible, responsive behaviors that adjust to changing conditions
    - **RESISTANT**: Change-resistant, conservative behaviors that maintain status quo

class RelationshipKind(Enum):
    """
    Taxonomy of relationship types in Social Fabric Matrix systems.

    Defines the various ways actors, institutions, resources, and processes can be
    related to each other in Hayden's institutional analysis framework. This comprehensive
    taxonomy enables detailed mapping of institutional dependencies, resource flows,
    power relationships, and system dynamics essential for SFM analysis.
    
    ## Theoretical Foundation
    
    Relationship analysis in SFM recognizes that socio-economic systems are fundamentally
    structured by relationships between actors, institutions, and resources. Hayden's
    framework emphasizes how these relationships create patterns of coordination,
    dependency, and power that shape economic outcomes and social welfare.
    
    ## Core Relationship Categories
    
    **Governance Relationships**: Authority, regulation, and institutional control
    **Resource Flow Relationships**: Economic exchanges and resource movements  
    **Knowledge Relationships**: Information transfer and learning processes
    **Social Relationships**: Collaboration, coordination, and mutual support
    **Influence Relationships**: Power dynamics and behavioral modification
    
    ## Usage Examples
    
    ### Governance and Authority Relationships
    ```python
    # Government regulatory authority
    epa = Actor(label="EPA", sector="Government")
    chemical_company = Actor(label="Chemical Manufacturer", sector="Industry")
    
    regulatory_rel = Relationship(

        kind=RelationshipKind.ADVOCATES_FOR,
        description="Policy support campaign"
    )
    ```
    
    ## Complex Relationship Networks
    
    ### Multi-Actor Policy Networks
    ```python
    # Create network of relationships around policy issue
    federal_agency = Actor(label="Federal Environmental Agency")
    state_agency = Actor(label="State Environmental Department") 
    local_government = Actor(label="City Council")
    industry = Actor(label="Manufacturing Industry")
    citizens = Actor(label="Local Citizens")
    
    # Hierarchical governance relationships
    mandate_rel = Relationship(
        source_id=federal_agency.id,
        target_id=state_agency.id,
        kind=RelationshipKind.MANDATES
    )
    
    delegate_rel = Relationship(
        source_id=state_agency.id,
        target_id=local_government.id,
        kind=RelationshipKind.DELEGATES
    )
    
    # Regulatory relationships
    regulate_rel = Relationship(
        source_id=local_government.id,
        target_id=industry.id,
        kind=RelationshipKind.REGULATES
    )
    
    # Accountability relationships
    account_rel = Relationship(
        source_id=local_government.id,
        target_id=citizens.id,
        kind=RelationshipKind.ACCOUNTABLE_TO
    )
    ```
    
    ## Relationship Direction and Symmetry
    
    Most relationships in SFM are **directional**, indicating flow or influence from
    source to target:
    
    - **GOVERNS**: Authority flows from government to governed entity
    - **SUPPLIES**: Resources flow from supplier to recipient
    - **INFLUENCES**: Impact flows from influencer to influenced
    
    Some relationships can be **bidirectional** or **symmetric**:
    
    - **COLLABORATES_WITH**: Mutual cooperation
    - **EXCHANGES_WITH**: Mutual exchange
    - **COMPETES_WITH**: Mutual rivalry
    
    ## Integration with Flow Analysis
    
    Relationships often involve specific flows that can be tracked:
    
    ```python
    # Relationship with associated flows
    payment_flow = Flow(
        label="Service Payment",
        nature=FlowNature.FINANCIAL,
        flow_type=FlowType.FINANCIAL
    )
    
    service_rel = Relationship(
        source_id=client.id,
        target_id=service_provider.id,
        kind=RelationshipKind.PAYS,
        flows=[payment_flow.id]  # Link specific flows to relationship
    )
    ```
    
    ## Hayden-Specific Institutional Relationships
    
    The taxonomy includes relationships particularly relevant to Hayden's analysis:
    
    - **REINFORCES/UNDERMINES**: Feedback relationships for institutional stability
    - **TRANSFORMS**: Fundamental institutional change relationships
    - **ENABLES/CONSTRAINS**: Capacity and limitation relationships
    - **LEGITIMIZES**: Authority and acceptance relationships
    
    ## Validation and Compatibility
    
    RelationshipKind works with validation systems to ensure logical consistency:
    
    ```python
    # Valid government-to-institution relationship
    governs_rel = Relationship(
        source_id=government_actor.id,
        target_id=regulated_institution.id,
        kind=RelationshipKind.GOVERNS  # Appropriate for this actor-institution pairing
    )
    
    # Validation will check compatibility of relationship type with actor types
    ```
